== PROJECT: TutorHelper - Level 4

---

== Overview

It is a Java sample application intended for Tutors who would like to organise their students' information.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to add payments to a student*.

** What it does: allows the tutor to record payment for his/her student and keep track of which month or year a particular payment amount was made.
** Justification: It is difficult for tutors to keep track of payment and this feature can help tutors manage their payments and ensure that he/she is fairly paid.
** Highlights: Making a new payment entry will update the person's details in the database. Only a maximum of $10 000 can be keyed in as payment.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to view tutor's earning for a specific month and year*.

** What it does: Tutor can view his total earnings across the board for a specific year and month.
** Justification: This feature allows tutor to sum up his monthly salary and allow him to better manage his financial accounts.
** Highlights: If no payment has been made for that particular month or year, then earnings displayed will be of default $0.

* *Minor enhancement*:

** Add Payment into TutorHelper (Pull request https://github.com[#12])
