== PROJECT: TutorHelper - Level 4

---

== Overview

It is a Java sample application intended for Tutors who would like to organise their students' information.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to group the students based on their tuition timing and sort accordingly to day or time*.

** What it does: allows the user to either group students by the day of the tuition or the timing. Grouping by day will sort the students in that day by their tuition timing and grouping by time will sort the students with that tuition timing by the days of the week.
** Justification: Tutors are busy and want to know how many classes they have to teach in a specific day or how often in a week they have to teach at a specific timing.
** Highlights: Grouping the students will permanently sort the list of students. This can be undone with the `undo` command.

* *Minor enhancement*:

** Add Subject and TuitionTiming into TutorHelper (Pull request https://github.com[#11])
** Updating of test cases for new changes (Pull requests https://github.com[#67], https://github.com[#75], https://github.com[#97], https://github.com[#122])
