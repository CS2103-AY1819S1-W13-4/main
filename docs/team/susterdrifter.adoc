== PROJECT: TutorHelper

---

== Overview

It is a Java sample application intended for Tutors who would like to organise their students' information.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the ability *to manipulate state of syllabus within subjects as well as copy a subject from one student to another*.

** What it does: User can add, remove, or mark syllabus from the specified subject. User can also copy a whole subject,
along its contents, to another student.
** Justification: Tutors need to differentiate between subjects of different levels or schools.
Allowing manipulation of syllabus provides greater amount of flexibility and details of each subject.
However, in the case where multiple students who actually studies the same content, `copysub` command
allow users to easily manage the subjects.
** Highlights: Copying can lead to duplicated syllabus and subjects which needs to be addressed.

* *Minor enhancement*:

** Add syllabus into TutorHelper
** Allow students to have multiple subjects
** Converts subjects to enumeration for easier management of code
** Data writing into storage of subject and its syllabus
