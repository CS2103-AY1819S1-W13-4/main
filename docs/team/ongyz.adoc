== PROJECT: TutorHelper

---

== Overview

It is a Java sample application intended for Tutors who would like to organise their students' information.
== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to edit existing syllabus entries*
** What it does: allows the user to edit existing syllabus entries.
** Justification: Curriculum of subjects taught in schools change constantly, a tutor could update syllabus of a subject whenever there are changes and the app should provide a convenient way to edit them.
** Highlights: Editing syllabus entries will cause changes in the database. The use of the editsyll command ensures that all other fields of student remains unedited.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to edit existing payment entries*
** What it does: allows the user to edit existing payment entries using the same paid command.
** Justification: Students could pay fees in installments or weekly instead of monthly, as such tutors may need to constantly edit payment entries for the month and the app should provide a convenient way to edit them.
** Highlights: Editing payment entries will cause changes in the database. The use of the paid command looks for existing payment entries with the same month and year.

* *Minor enhancement*:

** Updating of test cases for new changes
** XmlClasses for data writing into xml files for storage (Pull request https://github.com[#14])
