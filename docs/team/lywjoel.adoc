== Summary of Contributions

* *Contributed Code*: https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=lywjoel[RepoSense]

* *Major Enhancement*:
** Added *the ability to add and delete subjects taken to student entries* (Pull Request https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W13-4/main/pull/112[#112])
*** This enhancement allows the tutor to add and delete subjects taken by their students. Each subject will have its own list of syllabus topics.
*** Justification: Students of tutors may request to receive tuition for more than one subject from the same tutor. This enhancement allows the tutor to record such instances instead of creating a new student entry for each subject.
*** Highlights: A student entry must have at least one subject taken at all times. Logically, a student entry should not exist if the student is not taking a subject taught by the tutor.

* *Minor Enhancements*:
** [Deprecated] Added and updated a simple HTML display to facilitate display of student information (Pull Requests https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W13-4/main/pull/25[#25], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W13-4/main/pull/31[#31], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W13-4/main/pull/78[#78], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W13-4/main/pull/93[#93])
** Converted original HTML display to an FXML display (Pull Requests https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W13-4/main/pull/158[#158], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W13-4/main/pull/161[#161])
